# Life-expectancy-analysis

The idea of analysis: predict life expectancy in given country based of features such as the country GDP, fertility rate and population. Since the "target" varible here is quantitive , this is a regression problem. For this analysis, regression methods such as linear regression and Lasso were used. 

Data was taken from Gapminder (https://www.gapminder.org/).

Using cross validation methods, prediction accuracy has been improved.

For example, in accordance with Lasso's analysis, infant mortality is directly related to life expectancy.
